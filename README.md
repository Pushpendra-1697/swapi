# swapi
This project involves building a responsive web application that serves as a directory of planets from the Star Wars universe. Utilizing the Star Wars API (SWAPI), it fetches data about planets and their notable residents, presenting them in an intuitive card-based interface. The application features pagination for easy navigation through the list of planets and focuses on delivering a visually appealing user experience through modern styling techniques and responsive design.
